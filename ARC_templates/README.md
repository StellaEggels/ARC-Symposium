# Motivation and Solution


Users that want to initiate a project following the ARC structure directly in the DataHUB can use ARC templates. A minimal ARC template provides the basic folder structure with explanations in the readme. We updated the existing ARC template to the current standards and created two examples of experiment type- specific ARC templates, one for Genomics and one for Metabolomics. These additional experiment type - specific ARC templates can provide a starting point for new ARC creators that provide suggestions for suitable studies, assays, and metadata templates in the isa files, as well as a suggestion for a readme structure.


# Technical details

Template ARCs are stored in an arc_templates group in the DataHUB: https://git.nfdi4plants.org/arc_templates. Once the implementation is finalized, when creating a new project in the DataHUB the option "create from template" allows to select from the different ARC templates and initiate an ARC following their structure.
